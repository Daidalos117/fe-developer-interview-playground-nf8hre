Hi 👋,

welcome in this frontend playground.
We are were interested in what magic skills you have, so we prepared this teeny weeny task for you.

It's pretty simple. You're given 4 tasks:
0. (Optional) Customize your development environment if you need to.
1. Style simple card component according template here: https://imgur.com/a/4giahL8. Every card has these required properties: title, description and image. If the description is too long, display only the first 150 characters.
2. Style cards layout component – grid 3𐄂3. Each card should be possible to remove. It would be nice load more cards after click on button 'Load more' or something like that.
3. Asynchronously load cards data from https://dev.ntvr.co/react-challenge-api/data.json. Data ID corresponds with image ID.
4. Implement search input to filter specific cards according title or description.
5. (Optional) Render card image using lazy loading. It's possible to use third party packages.


The implementation should take approximately an 4 hours (with optional tasks even longer, ~5 hours). If you'll hit a snag, don't hesitate to ask for help.

So, we wish you happy coding and good luck 🍀
